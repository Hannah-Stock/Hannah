      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>“I always was a smaller girl, growing up mainly said I was ‘skin and bones’. Once I got into high school, I realized that’s not what I wanted to look like anymore. 

Soon, I started gaining a lot of weight my junior year. Once we went into quarantine my senior year, just like many other people, I was bored. I turned to working out because I had the equipment like a treadmill, elliptical, and some weights. Many would think that was a good thing, however, I turned back into my ‘skin and bones’ self. Lots of cardio, eating few calories, and very little protein. When I started seeing pictures of myself and hearing my family asking if I was okay, my mindset changed. Long story short, I wanted to feel a different type of healthy. Eat what I want but also fueling it with the right things. I wanted to workout, but not excessively. I wanted to get strong! This may be your goal too! I reached out to experienced individuals and got the right information and education I needed to be able to achieve what I wanted. I was proud of myself and I want others to feel the same way about themselves. I want to be the easy access you need to achieve your goals. </p>
